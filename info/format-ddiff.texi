@section Format specs for durations

Durations are somewhat ambiguous when it comes to representing them
through format specifiers.  Unlike point-in-time representations
durations specifiers can have an intra-line relationship.  So for
instance a duration of 128 seconds might be presented through @samp{%S}
as @samp{128} but similarly through @samp{%M:%S} as @samp{02:08}.

Date specs:
@verbatim
  %c  Equivalent to %w
  %d  Durations in days
  %F  Equivalent to %dd with no resorting to bigger units
  %m  Durations in months
  %w  Durations in weeks
  %y  Equivalent to %Y
  %Y  Durations in years

  %db Duration in business days
  %dB Equivalent to %db
@end verbatim

Time specs:
@verbatim
  %H  Durations in hours
  %I  Equivalent to %H
  %M  Durations in minutes
  %S  Durations in seconds
  %T  Equivalent to %Ss without resorting to bigger units
@end verbatim

General specs:
@verbatim
  %n  A newline character
  %t  A tab character
  %%  A literal % character
@end verbatim
