dateutils are a bunch of tools that revolve around fiddling with dates

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

The dateutils package is an attempt to provide a comprehensive set of
command line tools that behave intuitively, support a similar variety of
inputs, allow for normalised output and, most importantly, cover nearly
all tasks that arise whilst dealing with huge amounts of dates and
unusual calendars.

In day to day business, the authors have run across a plethora of
approaches to tackle seemingly simple problems.  When the command line
is a necessity most of these involve perl or awk, which suffer from bad
maintainability simply because those tools weren't made to process dates
and times in particular, and for the same reason those approaches are
anything but fast.

And conversely, good maintainability and fast processing is often seen
in integrated systems, such as R or database solutions but they come at
a price: little flexibility.  It's very uncommon to import billions of
dates into a database just to compare if they are greater than or equal
to a given date.  Besides, most of the time those billions of dates come
from external sources and have to be brought into shape before or whilst
importing them into an integrated system.


@node Calendars
@chapter Calendars

All of the dateutils command line apps are built around a library,
date-core.  The textual representation of dates is converted to an
internal one first, then the date operation is performed and the
internal representation in the end is converted back to a textual
one.

While many of the tools that provide date arithmetic or conversions
employ a single standard internal representation (mostly days since a
reference date, or seconds since the epoch), the date-core library
provides a variety of calendars, each suitable for one or more
specific tasks.

Usually it's the tools' task to find out which calendar is the best
for the task at hand, but to use the library directly we give an
overview of the supported calendars here along with some of their
properties.

@section ymd, aka gregorian

This is the `ordinary' calendar, holding a year, a month and the day
of the month.  Years are subdivided into 12 months, months are
subdivided into 28 to 31 days.

The canonical input and output format is @code{%Y-%m-%d}.

@section ymcw

This is a calendric system used at some security exchanges, it holds a
year, a month, a weekday and the count of the weekday within the
month.  This holds dates like the third Thursday in March 2011.  Years
are subdivided into months as in the ymd calendar, months consist of
at least 4 and up to 5 weeks and weeks are subdivided into weekdays,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

The canonical input and output format is @code{%Y-%m-%c-%w}.

@section daisy

This is one of the most common calendric systems, it counts the days
since (we originally went for daysi, short for days since, but after
the 100th spelling mistake, because daisy is so much more natural, we
decided to stick with daisy) a given reference date.  In the Julian
calendar this was the founding of Rome, in many database systems this
is the 1st Jan 1, or other convenient dates like the 1st Jan 1970 or
1st Jan 1900.

The dateutils reference day (at the moment) is the 31st Dec 1916, or
equivalently the Naught-th of Jan 1917.  This may look like an
arbitrary date but it has some interesting properties:
- it is a Sunday, so weekday computation is easy as it is a mod 7
  operation only
- the year is 1 mod 4, so the number of leap years between 1917 and
  another year Y is simply Y div 4.

Actually any date that suffices these properties is fine but 1917 is
the first after 1900, and dates <= 1900 that have different leap year
rules so cannot be as easily used as our reference date.

The daisy calendar has no notion of years or months.

The daisy calendar has no associated input or output format.  This is
due to its nature that the reference date is arbitrary.  Outlook: As
soon as Julian dates are supported, daisy will use its in/out format
specs.

@section bizda

This calendric system is actually a whole tribe of calendars, in its
canonical form this tracks the number of business days after last
month's ultimo.  Where business day means any non-weekend day.  Years
are divided into 12 months, each of which consists of 20 to 23
business days.

The canonical input and output format is @code{%Y-%m-%db}, where
@code{b} is a suffix modifier meaning business days since last month's
ultimo.  Similarly, @code{%Y-%m-%dB} stands for the business days until
this month's ultimo.

@node Algorithms
@chapter Algorithms

Coming from a financial background, shaving milliseconds off of code is
daily core business.  And that in turn is why some of the algorithms
used in dateutils might look different to what other people do.

In this chapter key concepts are briefly introduced.  For implementation
details see the @file{*-core.c} and @file{*-core.h} files.

@section 32-adic year-days

Months, in the Gregorian sense, are roughly 30 days long.  Some are
longer, one is shorter.  It comes in handy though that the average month
length is close to a 2-power, 32.  So we can introduce a 32-adic year as
follows:

@verbatim
year-day        traditional     32-adic m/d
0       19      Jan|00          00|19
1       20      Jan|01          00|20
31      50      Jan|31          01|18

32      51      Feb|01          01|19
59      78      Feb|28          02|14

60      79      Mar|01          02|15
90      109     Mar|31          03|13

91      110     Apr|01          03|14
120     139     Apr|30          04|11

121     140     May|01          04|12
151     170     May|31          05|10

181     200     Jun|30          06|08
212     231     Jul|31          07|07
243     262     Aug|31          08|06
273     292     Sep|30          09|04
304     323     Oct|31          10|03
334     353     Nov|30          11|01
365     384     Dec|31          12|00
@end verbatim

As can be seen, the year has 19 unexplained days at the beginning, and,
more unintuitively, (traditional) months start in one (32-adic) month
and end in another.  But the ending always coincides with the
traditional months.

Another nice thing about this year is that all months end on a
@emph{different} day; this is nice because you can deduce the month just
by naming its ending (or the beginning respectively, as all months as a
consequence also start on a different day).

The final nice thing lies in the property, that months that end (or
start) on a day <=16, are affected by the leap day introduced in Feb in
the traditional Gregorian calendar.  By affected we mean, that the
months start (and end) one day off in a leap year.

So to cut this story short, the 32-adic year makes computations easier
that need a lot of mapping between the day in the year and the month+day
representation, e.g. weekday computations (the 32-adic year preserves
weekdays as 32 and 7 are co-prime), day differences, etc.

The algorithm to get the day of the year from a 32-adic month+day is:
@verbatim
Input: m <- 32-adic month
       d <- 32-adic day of month
Output: yd -> day of year

yd <- m * 32 + d - 19
@end verbatim

And conversely.  The algorithm to get the 32-adic month+day is trivial.

To convert between 32-adic month+day and Gregorian month+day:
@verbatim
Input: m <- 32-adic month
       d <- 32-adic day of month
Output: m -> 32-adic month
        d -> 32-adic day of month

/* day of month of the beginning and end of m */
bom <- get_beg_of_month(m)
eom <- get_end_of_month(m)

/* get yd as described above */
yd <- get_yd(m, d)

if d <= eom
        d <- yd - (32 * (m - 1) - 19 + bom - 1)
else
        d <- yd - (32 * m - 19 + eom)
        m <- m + 1
